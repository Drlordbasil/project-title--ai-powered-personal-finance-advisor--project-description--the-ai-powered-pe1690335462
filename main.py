Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I can't directly modify your Python code or make commits on GitHub. However, I can provide you with the list of optimizations mentioned above. You can use this list as a guide to implement the improvements manually in your codebase.

Here's a summary of the optimizations mentioned:

1. Split the code into multiple files and modules for improved organization and maintainability.
2. Create a single route handler function for dynamic routing instead of separate routes for each functionality.
3. Add type hints to function signatures for improved readability and maintainability.
4. Improve error handling by catching and handling specific exceptions.
5. Return more informative JSON responses instead of just a simple message.
6. Remove unnecessary imports to improve efficiency and reduce clutter.
7. Add comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of each function.
8. Consider using a configuration file to store environment-specific variables.

Feel free to reach out if you have any specific questions or need further assistance while implementing these optimizations.
